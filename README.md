Crucial melodies transposed and collected here for use with piezo buzzer.

Within each .ino file, you'll find:

A. In the setup section, a simple line of code defining the buzzer's pin location: pinMode(12, OUTPUT)
B. In the loop section, code that instructs the buzzer to perform different notes for different lengths of time. 
With the the command "tone()", you'll find in the parentheses the pin number of the buzzer followed by the the frequency of the note in Hz. 

When you set out to transpose and create your own buzzer songs/tones, be sure to check out the following website for converting notes into Hz frequencies:
